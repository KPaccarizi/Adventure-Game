Adventure Game
Welcome to the computerized "Adventure Game" repository! This project allows one or more players to embark on a thrilling adventure, exploring rooms, collecting treasures, and facing challenges.

Features
Room Exploration: Players can enter and exit rooms through doors, each connected by corridors. The corridors may lead to other rooms or nowhere at all.

Orientation: To help players navigate, a search feature allows them to find the name of the room they want to enter.

Additional Rules:

Players can leave messages in rooms for the next player to discover.
Treasures hold value and contribute to the player's success.
Energy is expended while moving between rooms, requiring players to forage for food to replenish energy.

Graphical User Interface
In conclusion, we have tried to make the game as attractive as possible for users through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This interface enhances clarity in understanding how an adventure game is developed. The game is set within a house, utilizing rooms such as the living room, kitchen, corridor, and bedroom. Our aim is to fulfill all the conditions specified for the development of the "Adventure Game."
